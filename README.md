# Arrows
An android app (Kotlin) and Server (Java/Spring Boot) to facilitate live feedback to presenters.

# Status
This project was part of a 3-day project, so there are **plenty** of issues with the code, this project is abandoned, but does function as intended.

# API
The API is used to manage a DB for users, along with hosting rooms so different instances of the app can communicate with each other. In interest of time for this project, instead of using a TCP connection to manage connection, the clients simply query the API. 

Tested with emulators for clients, unknown if functional for live.
